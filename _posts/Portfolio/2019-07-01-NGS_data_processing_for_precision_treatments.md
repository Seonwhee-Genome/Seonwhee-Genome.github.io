### 1. Overview  
Large-scale tumor molecular profiling based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized the field of precision oncology. I worked for the Institution for Refractory Cancer Research (IRCR) at Samsung Medical Center. One of the goals of the IRCR is to reveal the genetic mechanism that gives rise to glioblastoma (GBM), a malignant brain tumor, which can be used to inform therapeutic decisions in daily practice.  

In support of this effort, we designed a GBM-specific NGS panel called GliomaSCAN. I participated in advancing the NGS data pipeline and conducting molecular pathology and GMB oncology research to determine whether GliomaSCAN’s results were to other clinical evidence. Targeted gene panels like GliomaSCAN are more frequently used in clinical settings because they provide deeper coverage of selected areas of interest, have a faster turnaround time, and produce more clinically relevant data than broader genomic profiling accomplished using whole-exome sequencing (WES) or whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Moreover, target-enrichment approaches are less costly than WES or WGS. The South Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare began covering NGS panels under South Korea’s national health insurance.
